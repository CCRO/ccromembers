Hello,

Our system shows that <%= @person.name %> is with <%= @person.company.name %>.
OUr system shows that <%= @person.company.name %> is without a primary person.
<%= @person.name %> suggests that we assign primary person for <%= @person.company.name %> to:
<%= @first %> <%= @last %> - <%= @email %>
